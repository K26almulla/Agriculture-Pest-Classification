# 🌱 Agriculture Pest Classification 🐛

This project explores AI-driven pest classification using Deep Learning (CNNs) and Machine Learning (Decision Trees) to detect harmful and non-harmful insects in agricultural fields. The goal is to help farmers reduce crop losses and minimize pesticide use through automated pest detection.

## 📌 Project Overview

## 🚜 Problem Addressed

Agricultural pests cause significant crop losses, and traditional manual pest detection is time-consuming and error-prone. Our AI-based solution automates pest classification, improving efficiency and sustainability.

## 🔬 Approach & Technologies

- **Deep Learning**: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) trained on insect images for classification.
- **Machine Learning**: Decision Tree model implemented in RapidMiner for comparison.
- **Frameworks Used**: TensorFlow, Keras, OpenCV, and Pandas.

## 📊 Models Implemented

- **Custom CNN** – A deep learning model trained from scratch.
- **MobileNetV2** – A lightweight transfer learning model for efficient performance.
- **Xception** – A high-accuracy model fine-tuned for best results.
- **Decision Tree (ML Model)** – Implemented in RapidMiner for structured data classification.

## 🎯 Key Features

- **AI-powered pest detection** – Classifies pests into harmful and non-harmful categories.
- **High accuracy models** – CNNs outperform traditional methods in classification.
- **Image-based recognition** – Uses convolutional layers to detect complex patterns in images.
- **Real-time monitoring potential** – Can be deployed in IoT-enabled smart farms.
- **Sustainable Agriculture** – Reduces unnecessary pesticide use, preserving biodiversity.

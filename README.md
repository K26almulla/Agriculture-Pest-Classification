#🌱 Agriculture Pest Classification 🐛

This project explores AI-driven pest classification using Deep Learning (CNNs) and Machine Learning (Decision Trees) to detect harmful and non-harmful insects in agricultural fields. The goal is to help farmers reduce crop losses and minimize pesticide use through automated pest detection.
📌 Project Overview

🚜 Problem Addressed
Agricultural pests cause significant crop losses, and traditional manual pest detection is time-consuming and error-prone. Our AI-based solution automates pest classification, improving efficiency and sustainability.
🔬 Approach & Technologies
Deep Learning: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) trained on insect images for classification.
Machine Learning: Decision Tree model implemented in RapidMiner for comparison.
Frameworks Used: TensorFlow, Keras, OpenCV, and Pandas.
📊 Models Implemented
✅ Custom CNN – A deep learning model trained from scratch.
✅ MobileNetV2 – A lightweight transfer learning model for efficient performance.
✅ Xception – A high-accuracy model fine-tuned for best results.
✅ Decision Tree (ML Model) – Implemented in RapidMiner for structured data classification.
